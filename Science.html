The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) aka NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) is a group of 7 satellites developed by ISRO. This system provides a Global Positioning System (GPS) service in India. It provides real-time positioning and timing services. The system covers areas from India extending up to 1500 kms and is expected to reach more areas in the future.</p>

* NavIC is a satellite navigation system that has contributed to India's satellite technology in several ways, including: 

<p style="color:red;">
1.Independence</p>
NavIC is an independent, indigenous system that's owned and operated by India. It was developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to reduce India's reliance on foreign satellite systems. 
<p style="color:red;">
2. Accuracy</p>
NavIC provides positioning accuracy of better than 10 meters in India and better than 20 meters in the surrounding region. This is more accurate than GPS, which has a positional accuracy of 15-20 meters. 
<p style="color:red;">
3. Applications</p>
NavIC has many applications, including in transportation, agriculture, disaster management, and defense. 
<p style="color:red;">
4. Services</p>
NavIC offers two services: a Standard Positioning Service (SPS) for civilian users and a Restricted Service (RS) for authorized users. 
<p style="color:red;">
5. Coverage</p>
NavIC covers India and the surrounding region up to 1,500 kilometers beyond the Indian boundary. 
<p style="color:red;">
6. Second generation</p>
The second generation of NavIC satellites, including the NVS-01, have improved accuracy, signal resilience, and performance in challenging environments. The NVS-01 also includes an indigenously developed atomic clock to replace the previous Israeli rubidium clock. 
<p style="color:red;">
7. Chipsets</p>
NavIC is now supported by "Made in India" chipsets.

* NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) is a satellite navigation system that helps with weather forecasting, disaster management, and navigation in several ways: 
<p style="color:red;">
1. Weather forecasting</p>
NavIC provides atmospheric data that helps improve weather predictions. This helps people prepare for weather events and leads to better preparedness. 
<p style="color:red;">
2. Disaster management</p>
NavIC helps with disaster management by providing real-time location data for affected areas. This helps with: 
<p style="color:red;">
3. Monitoring and tracking:</p> NavIC can track the movement and intensity of natural disasters like cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. 
Issuing warnings: NavIC data helps authorities issue timely warnings to communities in the path of natural disasters. 
<p style="color:red;">
4. Coordinating relief efforts:</p> NavIC helps coordinate relief efforts by ensuring that assistance reaches the right places promptly. 
<p style="color:red;">
5. Navigation</p>
NavIC provides precise positioning information for navigation in transportation, agriculture, and maritime navigation. 
<p style="color:red;">
6. Surveying</p>
NavIC helps with land surveying, mapping, and geodetic data collection. 
<p style="color:red;">
7. Timing</p>
NavIC provides highly accurate timing signals that are vital for sectors like telecommunications and power grid synchronization.
