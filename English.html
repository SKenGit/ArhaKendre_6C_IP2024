Ila Sachani, from Moti Vavdi village in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, is known for her vibrant embroidery creations. Ila Sachani’s journey began in the quiet setting of Amreli, Gujarat, where she was born into a farmer’s family. </br></br>

From the beginning, life resented its challenges, as Ila was  born with hands that couldn’t be used conventionally.
Ila’s mother and grandmother were skilled in the traditional art of Kathiawar embroidery and decided to share this art with Ila. They taught her to create many beautiful patterns using her feet!</br></br>

 Ila accepted the challenge with determination. Her parents also helped her learn to do things with her legs, like eating and combing her hair. </br></br>

With determination, Ila mastered threading needles and learned various embroidery styles beyond Gujarat like Kachhi, Kashmiri, Lucknawi and others.</br></br>
Initially creating designs for family and friends, Ila’s talent soon gained local admiration and government recognition.</br> Her work was showcased at state exhibitions, leading to national acclaim and awards, including the President’s Medal.</br></br>

Through her art, Ila not only found financial independence but also inspired others to overcome challenges with perseverance and positivity.</br> </br>She proved that challenges can be turned into victories with focus, hard work, positivity and never giving up.</br> Her embroidery, crafted with her feet, exemplifies how art transcends physical limitations to touch hearts and souls.
